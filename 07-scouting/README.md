# Scouting: The Heart of Crowdsourced Diligence

## What Scouts Do

Scouts contribute to the Yes Room by:

1. **Evaluating** — using the 5-axis framework to assess the raise
2. **Researching** — adding market analysis, comparables, risk models
3. **Creating artifacts** — diagrams, maps, prototypes, documentation
4. **Asking questions** — surfacing what's missing or unclear
5. **Building community** — helping other scouts and improving the system

## How to Become a Scout

1. **Read the [Scouting Manifesto](../00-charter/scouting-manifesto.md)**
2. **Read the [Game Overview](../00-charter/game-overview.md)**
3. **Fork this repository**
4. **Start evaluating** — use the [evaluation template](templates/evaluation-template.md)
5. **Submit a PR** — contribute your evaluation or artifact
6. **Earn points** — see your name on the [leaderboard](leaderboard/)

## How to Submit Evaluations

### Via Pull Request

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new file in `evaluations/` using the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-scout-handle-eval-v1.md`
3. Use the [evaluation template](templates/evaluation-template.md)
4. Submit a PR
5. Wait for review and merge

### Via Issue

1. Open an issue
2. Use the evaluation template
3. We'll convert it to a file and add it to evaluations/

## How Scoring Works

See [Game Overview](../00-charter/game-overview.md) for detailed mechanics.

**High level:**

- Base points for evaluations (100 points)
- Bonus points for artifacts (50–200 points)
- Multipliers for early scouts, high quality, consistency
- Leaderboard tracks total contributions
