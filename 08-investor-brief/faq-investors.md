## Common Questions from Investors

### How does the Yes/No protocol work?

You read the Yes Room.

You make a binary decision:

- ✔️ **YES** — I see it. I'm in.
- ❌ **NO** — I don't. No further cycles.

There are no meetings,
no "quick calls,"
no drawn-out diligence,
no "circling back,"
no pitching.

This protocol:

- protects founder time
- protects investor time
- removes ambiguity
- respects sovereignty
- collapses verification distance

You can make a confident decision in 10–20 minutes.

### What if I have questions?

Check the Yes Room.

If the answer isn't in the repo:

- Open an Issue
- A scout or maintainer will respond
- OR the question will be added to the FAQ

This keeps everything public, transparent, and additive.

No private threads.
No off-chain confusion.

### How do I invest?

Decide "Yes" via email or DMs.

You'll receive:

- investment docs
- your Investor Number
- your engraved Yes Pen information

Send funds

Your spot is locked in the Yes Ledger

Everything is fast, clean, and timestamped.

### What's the minimum investment?

TBD based on raise stage and allocation strategy.

Most Yes Pen Raises will use:

- $1k minimum for community supporters
- $5k–$25k for angels
- $50k+ for institutions

For this raise, see the Current Status file.

### What's the valuation?

Listed in:

`06-traction-metrics/current-status.md`

It is fixed.

No negotiation.

No back-and-forth.

If the valuation doesn't feel fair → simply choose No.

### What's the use of funds?

Detailed breakdown in:

`06-traction-metrics/use-of-funds.md`

High-level:

- Build Conscious Economics infrastructure
- Build Yes Room tooling
- Build Yes Pen production pipeline
- Fund initial experiments & templates
- Support scouting ecosystem
- Sustain early movement momentum

The raise is about mechanism creation, not burn-through operations.

### What are the terms?

- Standard SAFE or SAFE-like structure
- No board
- No control provisions
- No hidden clauses
- No special conditions
- No negotiation

Terms are public so all investors get the same deal.

### How do scouts get compensated?

Scouts are rewarded through:

- Multipliers (engraved into their Yes Pen)
- Recognition (leaderboard, first-believer status)
- Future opportunities (certification, scout network)
- Option to invest early in future raises

Scouts do not get paid directly;
they earn reputation, signal, and placement in a new capital network.

### What happens if the raise fails?

Fail = raise doesn't complete or doesn't meet threshold.

If this happens:

- All funds are returned (if applicable)
- The Yes Room remains as a public artifact
- Learnings are documented
- The next iteration improves the mechanism
- The experiment still moves the movement forward.

### Can I see other investors who said Yes?

Yes — transparency is part of Conscious Economics.

The Yes Ledger displays:

- investor number
- timestamp
- multiplier tier
- (optional) name or pseudonym

Some investors prefer to remain anonymous; that is supported.

### How is this different from other raises?

This raise:

- has no meetings
- uses open, crowdsourced diligence
- treats investor time as sacred
- treats founder time as sacred
- removes ambiguity
- provides unmatched context
- doesn't rely on status or warm intros
- rewards early conviction structurally
- makes belief a collectible, physical artifact

This is not a pitch.

This is a mechanism.
