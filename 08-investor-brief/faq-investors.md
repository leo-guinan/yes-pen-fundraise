## Common Questions from Investors

### How does the Yes/No protocol work?

You read the Yes Room.

You make a binary decision:

- ✔️ **YES** — I see it. I'm in.
- ❌ **NO** — I don't. No further cycles.

There are no meetings,
no "quick calls,"
no drawn-out diligence,
no "circling back,"
no pitching.

This protocol:

- protects founder time
- protects investor time
- removes ambiguity
- respects sovereignty
- collapses verification distance

You can make a confident decision in 10–20 minutes.

### What if I have questions?

Check the Yes Room.

If the answer isn't in the repo:

- Open an Issue
- A scout or maintainer will respond
- OR the question will be added to the FAQ

This keeps everything public, transparent, and additive.

No private threads.
No off-chain confusion.

### How do I invest?

**Step 1:** Press the YesPen (or commit via email/DMs)

**Step 2:** TRUST computes your terms based on:
- Current base valuation
- Your commitment size
- Time since raise start

**Step 3:** LOVE records your commitment with:
- Timestamp
- Locked effective valuation
- 7-day TTL deadline

**Step 4:** Wire funds within 7 days

**Step 5:** Your spot is confirmed, YesPen engraved, investor number assigned

**If you don't wire within 7 days:**
- Your commitment expires
- You go to end of queue
- You must commit again (at worse terms due to time decay)

Everything is fast, clean, and timestamped.

### What's the minimum investment?

TBD based on raise stage and allocation strategy.

Most Yes Pen Raises will use:

- $1k minimum for community supporters
- $5k–$25k for angels
- $50k+ for institutions

For this raise, see the Current Status file.

### What's the valuation?

The valuation cap is **time-indexed** — it changes based on when you commit.

**Current base valuation:** Listed in `06-traction-metrics/current-status.md`

**How it works:**
- Base valuation starts at a set cap (e.g., $5M)
- It decays over time (e.g., 2% per day) as information spreads
- Your effective valuation also depends on:
  - **When you commit** (earlier = better terms)
  - **How much you commit** (larger = better terms)

**Example:**
- Day 2, $100k commitment → Effective cap ~$3.67M
- Day 20, $10k commitment → Effective cap ~$3.40M

**No negotiation. No back-and-forth.**

The formulas are public. TRUST calculates your terms. LOVE records them.

If the valuation doesn't feel fair → simply choose No.

### What's the use of funds?

Detailed breakdown in:

`06-traction-metrics/use-of-funds.md`

High-level:

- Build Conscious Economics infrastructure
- Build Yes Room tooling
- Build Yes Pen production pipeline
- Fund initial experiments & templates
- Support scouting ecosystem
- Sustain early movement momentum

The raise is about mechanism creation, not burn-through operations.

### What are the terms?

We raise on a **SAFE-T** — a Time-Indexed SAFE powered by TRUST and recorded on LOVE.

**SAFE-T Structure:**
- Standard SAFE with time-indexed valuation cap
- No board
- No control provisions
- No hidden clauses
- No special conditions
- No negotiation

**How Pricing Works:**
- **TRUST** (the pricing engine) calculates your effective valuation based on:
  - When you commit (earlier = better terms)
  - How much you commit (larger = better terms)
  - Current base valuation (decays over time)
- **LOVE** (the ledger) records your commitment timestamp and terms
- You have 7 days to wire funds or lose your spot

**Terms are formulaic, public, and non-negotiable.**

All investors see the same formulas. Your terms depend on timing and commitment size.

### How do scouts get compensated?

Scouts are rewarded through:

- Multipliers (engraved into their Yes Pen)
- Recognition (leaderboard, first-believer status)
- Future opportunities (certification, scout network)
- Option to invest early in future raises

Scouts do not get paid directly;
they earn reputation, signal, and placement in a new capital network.

### What happens if the raise fails?

Fail = raise doesn't complete or doesn't meet threshold.

If this happens:

- All funds are returned (if applicable)
- The Yes Room remains as a public artifact
- Learnings are documented
- The next iteration improves the mechanism
- The experiment still moves the movement forward.

### Can I see other investors who said Yes?

Yes — transparency is part of Conscious Economics.

**LOVE (Ledger of Verifiable Events)** displays:

- investor number
- commitment timestamp
- commitment size
- effective valuation
- queue position
- status (awaiting wire / confirmed / expired)
- (optional) name or pseudonym

Some investors prefer to remain anonymous; that is supported.

All commitments are public, timestamped, and verifiable.

### How is this different from other raises?

This raise:

- **SAFE-T structure** — Time-indexed pricing, no negotiation
- **TRUST engine** — Public formulas, deterministic terms
- **LOVE ledger** — All commitments recorded, verifiable, transparent
- **No meetings** — Yes/No protocol, no back-and-forth
- **Open diligence** — Crowdsourced, public, transparent
- **Time-respecting** — Protects founder and investor time
- **Rewards conviction** — Early + large commitments get better terms
- **Physical artifact** — YesPen engraving makes belief tangible

**This is not a pitch.**

**This is a mechanism.**

**Pricing by time. Memory by design. Commitment without negotiation.**
