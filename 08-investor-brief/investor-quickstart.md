# ⚡️ Investor Quickstart: How to Read This Repo in 10–20 Minutes

## The 10-Minute Read

If you only have 10 minutes:

1. **Read [README.md](../README.md)** — understand what this is
2. **Read [Thesis](thesis.md)** — understand why this is investable
3. **Read [Yes/No Protocol](../00-charter/yes-no-protocol.md)** — understand how decisions work
4. **Scan [Current Status](../06-traction-metrics/current-status.md)** — see where we are
5. **Make your decision** — Yes or No

That's it.

## The 20-Minute Read

If you have 20 minutes:

6. **Read [Product Overview](../02-vision-product/product-overview.md)** — understand the mechanism
7. **Read [Market Overview](../03-market-memetics/market-overview.md)** — understand where this fits
8. **Read [Risks](../05-risk-constraints/risks.md)** — understand constraints

## The Deep Dive

If you want deeper conviction:

- **Read all of [02-vision-product/](../02-vision-product/)** — full product understanding
- **Read all of [03-market-memetics/](../03-market-memetics/)** — full market analysis
- **Read all of [04-system-design/](../04-system-design/)** — full mechanism design
- **Read top scout evaluations** — crowdsourced diligence
- **Read keystone artifacts** — deeper analysis

At that point you'll know more than most VCs do after weeks of diligence.

## The Decision

After reading, ask yourself:

1. Do I understand what this is?
2. Do I believe this can work?
3. Do I want to be part of this?

**If YES → invest.**

**If NO → that's okay. This isn't for you.**
