# SAFE-T

**A Time-Indexed SAFE powered by TRUST, recorded on LOVE**

---

## Overview

SAFE-T is a simple, deterministic fundraising instrument.

Instead of negotiating price endlessly, the valuation:

• Decays over time
• Rewards early conviction
• Locks when commitment occurs
• Enforces payment windows
• Records terms immutably

**This round is governed by code, not negotiation.**

---

## Instrument

You are investing via a **SAFE-T (Time-Indexed SAFE)**.

This is a standard SAFE with one addition:

**The valuation cap changes with time.**

Once you commit, your price is locked.

---

## Pricing Model — TRUST v1.0

The valuation cap is computed in real-time using a transparent formula:

```
Cap_today = max(Initial Cap × (1 - 0.5% × Days Elapsed), Floor)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial Cap | $4,000,000 |
| Decay Rate | 0.5% / day |
| Minimum Cap (Floor) | $3,200,000 |

This value is publicly visible on the live round display.

## Commitment Size Discounts

Larger commitments are rewarded with better terms:

| Investment | Discount |
|------------|----------|
| $10k–$24k | none |
| $25k–$49k | 5% |
| $50k–$99k | 10% |
| $100k+ | 15% |

**Final Cap = Cap_today × (1 - discount)**

---

## Locking Terms — The YesPen

Terms are locked at the moment you press the Yes Pen.

That press records:

• Timestamp
• Amount
• Effective valuation
• Equity percentage
• TTL window

This creates a digitally notarized record known as a **LOVE Note**.

---

## 7-Day Wire Window (TTL)

Once you commit, you have:

**7 days to wire funds.**

If funds are not received:

• Your commitment expires
• Your spot is released
• You must recommit at the new price
• No extensions

**This is automatic.**

---

## Ledger Transparency

A public ledger displays:

• Active commitments
• Confirmed investments
• Locked valuations
• TTL deadlines

**No back rooms.**

**No side deals.**

**No hidden terms.**

---

## Negotiation Policy

**There is none.**

The system is the deal.

---

## Legal

This round is executed as a standard SAFE under:

**Entity:** <YOUR LEGAL ENTITY>  
**Jurisdiction:** <STATE / COUNTRY>

The legal SAFE agreement will be provided before wiring.

**SAFE-T modifies pricing behavior only.**

All other SAFE terms remain standard.
