# Investment Thesis

## The High-Level Thesis

**The Yes Pen Raise is building the easiest way to raise money on an idea.**

This works because:

1. **Diligence is crowdsourced** — scouts evaluate everything transparently
2. **Truth is surfaced** — transparency reveals what matters
3. **Signal is proven** — community and traction speak for themselves
4. **Context is built** — more information than any investor could generate alone
5. **Decision is simple** — Yes or No, no middle ground

## The Filter Statement

> "We run a Yes/No raise. Diligence is crowdsourced, transparent, and always-on. You can read everything in the Yes Room. If you see it, invest. If you don't see it, that's okay — this raise isn't for you."

**This is not a pitch. It's a filter.**

We're selecting for:

- High-pattern-recognition capital
- Low-ego investors
- Fast decision-makers

- Conscious Economics alignment

- Creating a template others can use
- Eliminating time violence from the system

**If you see it, you see it. If you don't, that's okay.**
