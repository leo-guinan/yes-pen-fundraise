# Yes Pen Raise PRD

## Overview

The Yes Pen Raise is a new mechanism for early-stage fundraising, built on:

- binary Yes/No decisions,
- open, crowdsourced diligence (Yes Room),
- community scouting,
- and symbolic, engraved artifacts (Yes Pens).

## Goals

- Eliminate time violence in fundraising
- Compress decision cycles for investors
- Reward early believers with transparent multipliers
- Make diligence a public good, not a private gatekeeping exercise
- Align founders, investors, and scouts around trust and clarity
- Prototype Conscious Economics as a real, working system

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The system must:

**Provide a public Yes Room (GitHub repo) with:**

- founder docs
- product overview
- market analysis
- system design
- scouting contributions

**Support Yes/No Investor Protocol:**

- investors review repo
- decide Yes/No within a fixed window (e.g., 72 hours)
- no meetings or long back-and-forth required

**Run the Scouting Game:**

- scouts can submit evaluations and artifacts
- points & multipliers are calculated
- leaderboard visible or reconstructible

**Maintain a Yes Ledger:**

- signing order
- valuation locked
- premium tier
- multipliers

**Produce engraving specs for Yes Pens:**

- Investor #
- Valuation
- Premium/multiplier
- Date

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Transparency** – everything relevant lives in the repo
- **Simplicity** – minimal custom tooling; GitHub-first
- **Reliability** – contributions and history are preserved
- **Composability** – the template can be forked for future raises
- **Auditability** – investor decisions can be traced back to visible information

## User Flows

### Founder Flow

1. Initializes Yes Room repo
2. Fills in founder, product, market, system docs
3. Announces raise + Yes/No protocol
4. Lets scouts populate the Yes Room
5. Shares repo link with investors
6. Collects Yes/No decisions
7. Updates Yes Ledger
8. Produces and ships Yes Pens

### Investor Flow

1. Receives invite + Yes/No protocol
2. Reviews Yes Room (20–40 minutes)
3. Decides Yes or No
4. If Yes:
   - commits capital
   - receives investor # and multiplier
   - eventually receives engraved Yes Pen

### Scout Flow

(As in Scouting Game PRD.)

## Success Metrics

- Time to close initial raise
- Founder hours spent on fundraising vs. traditional methods
- # of investors making Yes/No decisions
- # of scouts and contributions
- Investor satisfaction with clarity and signal
- Repeat usage (future founders copying the template)
