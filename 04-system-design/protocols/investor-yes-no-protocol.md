# Investor Yes/No Protocol

## The Binary Investment Protocol

### Process

1. **Review Yes Room** — Read the repository (start with 08-investor-brief/)
2. **Decide Yes/No** — Make your decision within 72 hours
3. **No meetings** — No back-and-forth, no questions, no negotiation

### If Yes

- Eventually receive engraved Yes Pen

- No explanation required
- No harm, no foul
