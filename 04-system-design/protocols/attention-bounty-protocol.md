# Attention Bounty Protocol

## Rules for Conscious Attention Capture

### Principles

Attention bounties reward scouts for bringing high-signal attention to the Yes Pen Raise without manipulation.

### How It Works

1. **Identify high-signal individuals** — Investors, scouts, founders who would benefit from seeing this
2. **Share authentically** — No spam, no manipulation, no pressure
3. **Track attribution** — If someone you share with becomes a scout or investor, you earn lineage points
4. **Respect boundaries** — One authentic share, not repeated pestering

### What Counts

- Sharing Yes Room link with context
- Introducing founder to relevant investor
- Bringing scout who contributes quality work
- Amplifying signal in communities (Farcaster, Twitter, etc.)

### What Doesn't Count

- Spam messaging
- Manipulative tactics
- Repeated pestering
- Fake engagement

### Rewards

- Lineage points for scouts/investors brought in
- Recognition on leaderboard
- Potential multiplier bonus for high-impact attention capture
