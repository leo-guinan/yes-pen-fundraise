Designed to go viral:

- memeability
- remixability
- social graph propagation
- rituals and artifacts

## The Narrative

A story that spreads because it's simple:

> "Fundraising is broken. The Yes Pen fixes it by making diligence public and belief collectible."

Everyone who hears this knows it's true.

Everyone has seen the dysfunction.

Everyone wants a better system.

## The Community

This spreads because:

- scouts recruit scouts
- investors recruit investors
- founders recruit founders

The Yes Room becomes:

- a social object
- a public artifact
- a story you want to be part of
- a source of identity
- a proof-of-work

The meme is sticky because it contains truth + frustration + hope + novelty.
