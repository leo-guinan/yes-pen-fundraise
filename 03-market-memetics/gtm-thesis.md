# Go-to-Market Thesis

## How This Spreads

### Founders

Founders discover it through:

- Farcaster threads
- Twitter memes
- conversations about how broken fundraising feels
- other founders running Yes Rooms
- the Yes Pen artifacts

They use it because:

- they're sick of meetings
- they want community
- they want clarity
- they want to filter investors

### Scouts

Scouts join because:

- it's fun
- it builds skill
- it builds reputation
- it's a path to investing
- it creates identity

Scouts upgrade the Yes Room → generate more signal → attract more investors.

### Investors

Investors find it because:

- scouts talk
- communities amplify
- founders share Yes Pens
- investors love fast, clean decision processes

Investors stay because:

- clarity is addictive
- public diligence replaces private confusion
- the Yes Room is better than a Notion deck
- no meetings required

## Distribution Channels

- **Farcaster** (primary signal network)
- **Twitter/X** (memes → investors → media)
- **Discord communities** (Scouting groups)
- **GitHub** (the Yes Room is the distribution channel itself)
- **Newsletters** (Every, Lenny, Not Boring, etc.)
- **Buildspace ecosystem**
- **Metalabel ecosystem**
- **Brand evangelists through Yes Pens**

## Growth Loops

### 1. Scout Loop

Scouts → contribute → increase signal → attract more scouts.

### 2. Founder Loop

Founders → run raises → attract scouts → generate clarity → attract investors → attract more founders.

### 3. Investor Loop

Investors → make Yes decisions → share their Yes Pens → attract more investors → attract more founders.

### 4. Artifact Loop

Artifacts → become memes → generate attention → feed scouts → improve data room → attract capital.

## The Flywheel

**Attention → Scouts → Clarity → Signal → Capital → Artifacts → Memes → Attention**

It is self-sustaining, self-compounding, and community-powered.
