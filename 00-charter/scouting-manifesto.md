# Scouting Manifesto

## Why Scouts Matter

Traditional diligence is broken:

- **Closed-door** — investors evaluate in secret
- **Low-context** — founders can't see what's being evaluated
- **Adversarial** — investors try to "catch" founders
- **Time-violent** — endless meetings and back-and-forth
- **Status-based** — credentials matter more than pattern recognition

**Scouts fix this.**

Scouts are:

- **Pattern recognizers** — people who can see truth through noise
- **Truth surfacers** — evaluators who reveal what matters
- **Community builders** — contributors who make the Yes Room better
- **Signal generators** — people who prove that crowdsourced diligence works

## What Scouts Do

Scouts contribute to the Yes Room by:

1. **Evaluating** — using the 5-axis framework to assess the raise
2. **Researching** — adding market analysis, comparables, risk models
3. **Creating artifacts** — diagrams, maps, prototypes, documentation
4. **Asking questions** — surfacing what's missing or unclear
5. **Building community** — helping other scouts and improving the system

## The Scouting Game

Scouts earn points through contributions:

- **Evaluations** — base points for completing 5-axis evaluations
- **Artifacts** — bonus points for high-quality contributions
- **Research** — points for market analysis, comparables, risk models
- **Community** — points for helping other scouts and improving templates
- **Multipliers** — early scouts, high-quality work, and consistent contributions earn multipliers

See [Game Overview](game-overview.md) for detailed mechanics.

## The Scout Ethos

**Scouts operate from:**

- **Curiosity** — genuine interest in understanding what's being built
- **Integrity** — honest evaluation, not cheerleading or trolling
- **Pattern recognition** — ability to see truth through complexity
- **Contribution** — desire to make the Yes Room better for everyone
- **Sovereignty** — independent thinking, not groupthink

**Scouts don't:**

- Shill for investors
- Troll or attack
- Hide behind anonymity to be mean
- Contribute low-effort content
- Violate the Code of Conduct

## Why This Matters

Scouts prove that:

- **Crowdsourced diligence works** — many eyes see more than few
- **Transparency beats secrecy** — public evaluation surfaces truth
- **Pattern recognition > credentials** — signal matters more than status
- **Community > hierarchy** — distributed evaluation is more powerful

Scouts are building a new model for how diligence should work.

## The Scout Promise

**As a scout, I promise to:**

- Evaluate honestly and thoroughly
- Contribute high-quality work
- Respect the founder's time and vision
- Help other scouts improve
- Build something bigger than myself

**I understand that:**

- My evaluation becomes part of the public record
- Quality matters more than quantity
- I'm helping build a new model for fundraising
- This is a privilege, not a right
