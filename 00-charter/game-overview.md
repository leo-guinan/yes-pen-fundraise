# Scouting Game Overview

## The Core Loop

1. **Scout evaluates** — completes 5-axis evaluation
2. **Scout contributes** — submits PR with evaluation or artifact
3. **Points awarded** — based on quality and contribution type
4. **Multipliers applied** — early scouts, high quality, consistency
5. **Leaderboard updated** — public recognition of contributions

## Point System

### Base Points

- **Evaluation (complete)** — 100 points
  - Must cover all 5 axes
  - Must include Yes/No recommendation
  - Must include reasoning
  
- **Artifact (high quality)** — 50–200 points
  - Market maps, risk models, diagrams
  - Quality judged by founder + community
  
- **Research contribution** — 25–100 points
  - Market analysis, comparables, links
  - Depth and accuracy matter
  
- **Community contribution** — 10–50 points
  - Improving templates
  - Helping other scouts
  - Documentation improvements

### Multipliers

- **Early scout** — 1.5x (first 10 scouts)
- **High quality** — 1.5x–2x (judged by founder)
- **Consistent contributor** — 1.2x (3+ contributions)
- **Foundational artifact** — 2x–3x (becomes core reference)

### Example Calculation

```
Base evaluation: 100 points
Early scout multiplier: 1.5x
High quality multiplier: 1.5x
Total: 100 × 1.5 × 1.5 = 225 points
```

## The 5-Axis Evaluation Framework

Scouts evaluate on 5 axes:

1. **Founder Energy & Truth Pattern** — Does the founder have the energy and truth-telling ability to build this?
2. **Coherence & Clarity** — Is the vision clear and coherent?
3. **Market & Memetics** — Does the market exist and can it spread?
4. **Systems & Network Relativity** — Does the mechanism design work?
5. **Risk & Constraints** — What could go wrong and how is it mitigated?

Each axis gets:
- **Score** (1–10)
- **Reasoning** (why this score)
- **Questions** (what's unclear)
- **Suggestions** (how to improve)

## Leaderboard

The leaderboard tracks:

- **Total points** — cumulative contribution
- **Evaluations** — number of evaluations submitted
- **Artifacts** — number of artifacts created
- **Quality score** — average quality rating
- **Community impact** — how much others benefited

See [leaderboard/](07-scouting/leaderboard/) for current standings.

## Quality Standards

**High-quality evaluations:**

- Cover all 5 axes thoroughly
- Include specific examples and evidence
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Provide actionable suggestions
- Are well-written and clear

**High-quality artifacts:**

- Are original and useful
- Are well-designed and clear
- Add real value to the Yes Room
- Can be referenced by others
- Stand the test of time

## Recognition

Scouts are recognized through:

- **Leaderboard** — public ranking of contributions
- **Artifact credits** — attribution on artifacts used
- **Community mentions** — recognition in updates
- **Future opportunities** — early access to future raises, beta features, etc.

## Fair Play

**Don't:**

- Submit low-effort evaluations
- Copy others' work
- Game the system
- Violate the Code of Conduct
- Spam or troll

**Do:**

- Evaluate honestly
- Contribute high-quality work
- Help other scouts
- Build something bigger than yourself
- Respect the founder's time
