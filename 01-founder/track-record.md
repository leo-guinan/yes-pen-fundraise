# Track Record: Proof of Work

This section is a snapshot of the work that led here.

It shows pattern recognition: Leo has done the work before.

## Prior Projects

**TrustOps Framework** — system for redesigning team coordination and decision-making.

**Network Relativity Theory** — model explaining verification distance and trust decay.

**Time Violence Research** — exploration into how systems inflict cost on human attention.

**LoveOps / MetaSPN** — community-driven prediction ecosystem blending competition, clarity, and coherence.

**AI-native content & frameworks** — thousands of artifacts across Substack, X, Farcaster, GitHub.

**Community-creation experiments** — cohorts, competitions, ritual-based groups.

## Relevant Experience

- Systems engineering in complex corporate environments
- AI-native content creation and algorithmic storytelling
- Research into memetics, network theory, human behavior
- Startup operations at Copy.ai (building early AI systems and creator networks)
- Builder of decentralized, cooperative, community-based systems
- Lifelong student of mastery, clarity, and high-performance psychology

## Proof Points

- Thousands of readers across content platforms
- Dozens of founders influenced by these frameworks
- Communities created from scratch
- Recognition from high-signal thinkers
- Public ideas that spread through networks
- Track record of being extremely early to new patterns (AI creation, memetic systems, local-first tech, Conscious Economics)

## What I've Learned

- Systems fail when verification cost is too high.
- Trust is the real currency of coordination.
- Founders collapse under time violence.
- Communities become powerful when given structure.
- Symbolic artifacts (like the Yes Pen) create real commitment.
- Recognition is the foundation of human flourishing.
- You can fix markets by fixing attention.
- You can fix attention by fixing the incentives around belief.
- You can fix belief by creating better systems for capturing it.

All of this is embedded in the Yes Pen Raise.
